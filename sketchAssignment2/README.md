For the second sketch assignment, I worked on a simple animation. As I am still in the process of building my coding skills, this was still a bit challenging 
for me but I think I managed to figure it out. 

Whenever I think of animated art, I am brought back to my childhood when I used to watch colorful cartoons. As a result, I decided to go with bright and fun colors. 
I like the playful element of the movement that the circles create, as well as the vibrant colors. 

For my final animation assignment I hope to build onto what I currently have by changing the shapes from circles into flowers (if possible).
