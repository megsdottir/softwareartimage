For the first assignment, I started off with an image inspired by Piet Mondrian's 'Composition II in Red, Blue and Yellow'. 
I was intrigued in the idea of recreating a well known work of art in digital form to see how interacting with the work of art and changing it would also impact the way we view the work. 

Mondrian's work is very straightforward, using mainly line, sqaures, and rectangles with primary colors. However, when these elements can be changed, each change creates a new meaning, depending on how the person interacts with it. 

First, I started off by creating the shapes and adding the colors. This was a rather simple process, but took a bit of calculating in order to esnure that the shapes were lined up with one another in exactly the same way as Mondrian's painting. 

Then, I added gui's to control the height of the main square in the image, and added three more gui's to control the colors. 
Instead of introducing new colors to the image, I chose the same four colors that were used in the origianl artwork. Instead, the user can change the location of the color and create new images. 

This is what the original artwork looks like:

This is what the originnal artwork that I created in OF looks like:

Here are a few screenshots of me playing around with the GUI:
